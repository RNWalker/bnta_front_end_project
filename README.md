# bnta_front_end_project
Front-end client built using JavaScript and React connecting to Butterfly and Bees Media Shop backend server.

This project is the front end of Butterfly and Bee Media Shop, a backend built by another team at the Bright Network Technology Academy.

The database consists of different types of media, including books, music and films. This front end displays the content from the database in an aesthetically pleasing organisation for the customer. A customer can search for a particular
media using the search function or can navigate to the different categories using our quick access buttons. The value of the contents stored in the checkout are displayed on the right in the header and updated every time a customer adds or 
removes an item from the basket.

Once the customer has found all of their desired items, they can proceed to the checkout, where final adjustments can be made to their basket.

Once the customer checks out, they are navigated back to the original home screen, and a modal confirming their order pops up.
